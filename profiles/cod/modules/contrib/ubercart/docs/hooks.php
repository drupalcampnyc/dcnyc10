/**
 * Do extra processing when an item is added to the shopping cart.
 *
 * Some modules need to be able to hook into the process of adding items to a
 * cart. For example, an inventory system may need to check stock levels and
 * prevent an out of stock item from being added to a customer's cart. This hook
 * lets developers squeeze right in at the end of the process after the product
 * information is all loaded and the product is about to be added to the cart.
 * In the event that a product should not be added to the cart, you simply have
 * to return a failure message described below. This hook may also be used simply
 * to perform some routine action when products are added to the cart.
 *
 * @param $nid
 *   The node ID of the product
 * @param $qty
 *   The quantity being added
 * @param $data
 *   The data array, including attributes and model number adjustments
 * @return
 *   The function can use this data to whatever purpose to see if the item can
 *   be added to the cart or not. The function should return an array containing
 *   the result array. (This is due to the nature of Drupal's module_invoke_all()
 *   function. You must return an array within an array or other module data will
 *   end up getting ignored.) At this moment, there are only three keys:
 *   - "success": TRUE or FALSE for whether the specified quantity of the item
 *       may be added to the cart or not; defaults to TRUE.
 *   - "message": the fail message to display in the event of a failure; if
 *       omitted, Ubercart will display a default fail message.
 *   - "silent": return TRUE to suppress the display of any messages; useful
 *       when a module simply needs to do some other processing during an add to
 *       cart or fail silently.

 * Products that are added to a customer's cart are referred as items until the

 * Less." hook_cart_item() is in charge of acting on items at various times like
 * when they are being added to a cart, saved, loaded, and checked out.
 *
 * Here's the rationale for this hook: Products may change on a live site during
 * a price increase or change to attribute adjustments. If a user has previously
 * added an item to their cart, when they go to checkout or view their cart
 * screen we want the latest pricing and model numbers to show. So, the essential
 * product information is stored in the cart, but when the items in a cart are
 * loaded, modules are given a chance to adjust the data against the latest settings.

 *       uc_cart_get_contents(). This gives modules the chance to tweak information
 *       for items when the cart is being loaded prior to being view or added to
 *       an order. No return value is expected.
 *   - "can_ship" - Passed when a cart is being scanned for items that are not
 *       shippable items. Ãœbercart will bypass cart and checkout operations
 *       specifically related to tangible products if nothing in the cart is
 *       shippable. hook_cart_item functions that check for this op are expected
 *       to return TRUE or FALSE based on whether a product is shippable or not.
 *   - "remove" - Passed when an item is removed from the cart.
 *   - "checkout" - Passed for each item when the cart is being emptied for checkout.
 * @return
 *   No return value for load.
 *   TRUE or FALSE for can_ship.

/**
 * Perform actions on orders.
 *
 * An order in Ãœbercart represents a single transaction. Orders are created
 * during the checkout process where they sit in the database with a status of In
 * Checkout. When a customer completes checkout, the order's status gets updated
 * to show that the sale has gone through. Once an order is created, and even
 * during its creation, it may be acted on by any module to connect extra
 * information to an order. Every time an action occurs to an order, hook_order()
 * gets invoked to let your modules know what's happening and make stuff happen.
 *
 * @param $op
 *   The action being performed.
 * @param &$arg1
 *   This is the order object.
 * @param $arg2
 *   This is variable and is based on the value of $op:
 *   - new: Called when an order is created. $arg1 is a reference to the new
 *       order object, so modules may add to or modify the order at creation.
 *   - presave: Before an order object is saved, the hook gets invoked with this
 *       op to let other modules alter order data before it is written to the
 *       database. $order is a reference to the order object.
 *   - save: When an order object is being saved, the hook gets invoked with this
 *       op to let other modules do any necessary saving. $arg1 is a reference to
 *       the order object.
 *   - load: Called when an order is loaded after the order and product data has
 *       been loaded from the database. Passes $arg1 as the reference to the
 *       order object, so modules may add to or modify the order object when it's
 *       loaded.
 *   - submit: When a sale is being completed and the customer has clicked the
 *       Submit order button from the checkout screen, the hook is invoked with
 *       this op. This gives modules a chance to determine whether or not the
 *       order should be allowed. An example use of this is the credit module
 *       attempting to process payments when an order is submitted and returning
 *       a failure message if the payment failed.
 *
 *       To prevent an order from passing through, you must return an array
 *       resembling the following one with the failure message:
 *       @code
 *         return array(array('pass' => FALSE, 'message' => t('We were unable to process your credit card.')));
 *       @endcode
 *   - can_update: Called before an order's status is changed to make sure the
 *       order can be updated. $arg1 is the order object with the old order
 *       status ID ($arg1->order_status), and $arg2 is simply the new order
 *       status ID. Return FALSE to stop the update for some reason.
 *   - update: Called when an order's status is changed. $arg1 is the order
 *       object with the old order status ID ($arg1->order_status), and $arg2 is
 *       the new order status ID.
 *   - can_delete: Called before an order is deleted to verify that the order may
 *       be deleted. Returning FALSE will prevent a delete from happening. (For
 *       example, the payment module returns FALSE by default when an order has
 *       already received payments.)
 *   - delete: Called when an order is deleted and before the rest of the order
 *       information is removed from the database. Passes $arg1 as the order
 *       object to let your module clean up it's tables.
 *   - total: Called when the total for an order is being calculated after the
 *       total of the products has been added. Passes $arg1 as the order object.
 *       Expects in return a value (positive or negative) by which to modify the
 *       order total.
