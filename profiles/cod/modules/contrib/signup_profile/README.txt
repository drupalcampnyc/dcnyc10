Signup Profile integration module for Drupal 6
Provides Profile fields on signup forms.

### INSTALLATION

Place the module under the appropriate sites directory for your installation,
such as sites/all/modules.

Enable the module at Administer > Site building > Modules. You will need the
Profile module enabled as well as the Signup module.

### CONFIGURATION

Create some profile fields and decide whether you want them required and
visible on the user registration form. Signup Profile module supports fields in
either configuration (required and required and also visible on registration
form) as well as all entire profile fields.

Visit the Signup configuration page at Administer > Site configuration > Signup
to configure Signup Profile settings with your Signup-enabled nodes.

The first collapsed fieldset is the Signup Profile integration module settings.
You have two options, you may define what fields will show on Signup-enabled
nodes and you may set whether all Signup-enabled nodes have exposed Profile
fiels or if a View is used to limit. Signup Profile comes with a default View
you may use, known as 'signup_profile_limit_default'. You may override this View
as you like.
